# This is a script to display video in Flet
# It's a pretty simple script
# TL;DR - It's a Flet application with an image control
# and a basic opencv video capture from a webcame
# Only difference, is that the frame data is converted into a base64 image
# And that is then passed to a function 'update frame' that
# Decodes the base64 using utf-8 and tells the page to update
# Has to be put into it's own function as the image controle refused to update 
# while in the 'while' loop
